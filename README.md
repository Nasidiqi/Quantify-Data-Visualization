# Quantify-Data-Visualization
Data Visualization code for Quantify Datathon 2017 best presentation award. Based on LeafletJS and D3.js.

The working visualization can be viewed on http://www.byperth.com/quantify/ (Tested on Chrome Canary & Firefox on desktop. Mobile is not supported.)

### The data files for visualization are not included
Due to possible data license problems, I decided to remove the data files. Most of the data are from [Inside AirBnb](http://www.insideairbnb.com/). Then cleaned (wrangled) in Python or R.

### Technologies used for this visualization
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Leaflet, D3.js, Waypoints)
